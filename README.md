--Intro-- 

This is going to be a silly, Co-Op climbing game made to be played with friends! Work together as a team of at max 4 to reach the peak of the mountain, overcoming challenges and sometimes having to deal with stubborn or untrustworthy friends. Just be sure to read up on the scoutmaster's guide and REMEMBER Rule 0. 

 

--Mechanics--

Climb each different Mountain to reach the peak. You will have to manage a stamina bar which can gain inflictions caused by a variety of Obstacles. These are but not limited to: 

Getting hurt 

Being Poisoned 

Getting too cold/Getting too warm or burned 

Having one of your friends use a blowgun on you  

Hunger 

Luckily on your climb you can find luggage scattered around the mountain. These will be what makes or breaks your run because they contain items! These Items can be used to make climbing up the mountain easier or healing your stamina bar of the previously mentioned afflictions. One very important mechanic is Rule 0. Rule 0 states “No scout left behind”. On your climb up the mountain if a scout (Player character) doesn’t follow this rule and gets a certain distance ahead of the rest of the Scouts, they will meet the scoutmaster. The scoutmaster is a horrible entity, twisted and warped from being previously left behind. He will spawn and run after you for a set amount of time, catch you, then throw you off the mountain until you pass out. This brings us to passing out! This is a status that can happen anytime your stamina bar is completely filled with afflictions. You will fall to the ground, not be able to move your character, and have a death timer start. If the rest of your group cannot heal your stamina bar before the death timer runs out, you will die and become a ghost. However, if you have even a sliver of your stamina bar you will be able to stand up! If you do die and become a ghost, don't worry though! You can still spectate your friends who are alive and communicate with them. At the end of each mountain, there will also be a scout statue. This statue can be used to either revive all of your dead friends, or if everyone is alive you get a mythic item from the statue. These are extremely powerful items that you are absolutely going to want to hold on to (Unless you get the Cursed skull).  Proximity chat is also an important part of the game and reinforces Rule 0. Don’t get too far behind otherwise you might not be able to communicate with your friends.  

 

--Dynamics (What Changes?)--

As you reach the top of the first mountain with all of your friends, Congratulation! You have another mountain to scale with a different obstacle to overcome! For example, Caldera is a more horizontal map with a “The floor is lava” type obstacle, but the mountain before that can either be a barren desert or an icy mountain. Another thing that can change is your stamina bar. If you happen to perish and come back because of a scout statue, then a small bit of your stamina bar will be afflicted with a curse PERMANENETLY.  

 

--Aesthetics-- 

Its sort of a cartoony style contrasted harshly by the obstacles the scouts have to overcome. Everything does have a comedic charm but at the end of the day it is a survival of the fittest game. Only the strongest scouts who manage their resources and take smart risks can make it to the coveted PEAK.
